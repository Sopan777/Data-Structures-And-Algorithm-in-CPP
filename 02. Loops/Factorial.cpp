//  WAP to find the Factorial of a number entered by the user. 
// Hint : factorial of a number (n) = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * ........... * 1 and exists for positive numbers only. We write factorial as n! 
// So, factorial of 0! = 1, 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24 and so on. 
// Note - Please do not confuse factorial with NOT EQUAL TO operator, they are not the same.
